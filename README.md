# Pharmacy Database Design

This repository contains the **Entity-Relationship (ER) design**, **key-based data model**, and **business scenario** for a Pharmacy Management System.  
It includes both the **EER diagram** (PDF) and the **project presentation** (PPTX).

## 📂 Files Included
- **model5.pdf** — Extended Entity Relationship (EER) diagram with database structure and relationships.
- **Pharmacy Database Design.pptx** — Presentation explaining the business case, conceptual model, and key-based design.

## 📖 Project Overview

- **Customers & Insurance**
- **Invoices & Discounts**
- **Employees & Roles**
- **Products & Services**
